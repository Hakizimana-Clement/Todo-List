# Todo-List
## HEllo There âœ‹
Check out this todo list project written in node.js, express and mongoose.
You might think itâ€™s just another todo list, but wait, thereâ€™s more! You can also create custom titles for your todo lists and add them to the url endpoint. 
For example, if you want to create a todo list for work, just add /work at the end of the url.
And voila, you have your own work todo list. Pretty cool ðŸ˜Š
